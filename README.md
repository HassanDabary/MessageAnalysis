This is a code written by Hassan Dabary for ABGA Company screening assessment assignment.

I used some packages that I thought they are quite complicated to override in the assignment period, but for sure it's
possible to do it in bit longer periods if necessary, these packages are:
    permission_handler: ^10.2.0
        This is used to handle the permissions from the devices permission manager and it allows me to check whether my
        app have got the required permissions or not.
    intl: ^0.17.0
        This is used to play around the date format of the sending date of the message to be shown in a specific format.
    path_provider: ^2.0.2
        This is used to access the local path of the android device to download the csv file.
    csv:
        This is used to create the csv file of the extracted messages.
    open_file:
        This is used to access the downloaded file from the file system
